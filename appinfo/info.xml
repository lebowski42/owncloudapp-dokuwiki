	With this app you can use ownCloud as file-backend for DokuWiki. 
	You have to create a external local storage. Files in this storage
	can be used in DokuWiki, if you install the DokuWiki-plugin 'ownCloud'.
	
	This app wil sanitize filenames that way, they can be used in
	DokuWiki (no spaces, ...)
	
	Moving files in ownCloud doesn't affect wikipages using this file,
	becaus DokuWiki will use the fileID from the ownCloud database.
	
	This app also provides a menu-entry to generate a wikilink, display
	the authors or opening the detail-page.
	
	This app was developed using the code of the files_version-app for
	ownCloud, written by Frank Karlitschek. For everything outside the
	DokuWiki-Storage, this app behaves in the same way as the 
	files_version app (it is the same code).
	Inside the DokuWiki-Storage for versioning the DokuWiki-versioning-
	system is used.
	Because of this, you have to disable the files_version app.
